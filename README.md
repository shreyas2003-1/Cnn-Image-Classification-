# Cnn-Image-Classification-
This Footwear Classification Project uses deep learning techniques to classify images of footwear into distinct categories. The workflow involves loading the dataset, preprocessing the data, extracting features using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and performing classification.
This Footwear Classification Project is a deep learning-based solution designed to classify images of footwear into specific categories. The project workflow follows a structured pipeline that begins with data preprocessing, continues through model training and evaluation, and ends with deployment. The focus is on achieving high accuracy and robustness in classification tasks by leveraging CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks).

Workflow:
The steps involved in the project are as follows:

Load Dataset: Import the dataset containing labeled images of footwear.
Preprocess Data: Clean the data, resize images, normalize pixel values, and split into training and testing sets.
Feature Extraction: Use a CNN to extract meaningful features from the footwear images.
Train CNN Model: Train the neural network on the dataset using appropriate loss functions and optimizers.
Evaluate Model: Test the model's performance on unseen data and fine-tune hyperparameters.
Save Model: Save the trained model for future use.
Deploy Model: Deploy the trained model for real-world applications, such as e-commerce platforms or inventory management.
Libraries Used:
TensorFlow: To design and train the CNN model.
NumPy: For numerical computations.
Pandas: For dataset manipulation.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: For visualizations.
OpenCV: For image preprocessing tasks.
scikit-learn: For splitting data and evaluation metrics.
Project Use Case:
The project aims to address real-world challenges in industries like:

E-commerce: Automating the categorization of products f
or better inventory management and customer experience.
Retail: Enhancing in-store technology with image recognition systems for footwear tracking.
Logistics: Streamlining inventory checks and sorting tasks using AI-driven classification.
